Hello, my name is Kevin, I am a mechanical engineer, who is passionate about programming, computational mechanics and machine learning. These preferences led me to start working as a developer of a project carried out at EAFIT University. This project is about topology optimization using machine learning techniques.

On this page all the work carried out during the year of progress of the project was compiled, this includes the optimization algorithms and the codes used to develop the neural networks.
