## What is project?

The project on topological optimization using neural networks focuses on developing and enhancing machine learning models to address complex challenges in the field of structural optimization. Across several monthly reports, significant progress has been made, tackling key issues such as overfitting in neural network results and the need for greater diversity in the training dataset. Various neural network architectures have been explored, including U-Net and Vision Transformer (ViT), specifically tailored to address the unique challenges of topological optimization. 

Additionally, research has been conducted into hyperparameter automation to further improve the models' generalization capability. Through dataset expansion and the implementation of new architectures, the project aims to provide more accurate and applicable results across a wide range of scenarios, laying the groundwork for future research and advancements in the field of topological optimization through machine learning
