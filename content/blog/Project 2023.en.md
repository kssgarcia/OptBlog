In this post I will talk about the project which I will be working approximate one year. The project is about structural optimization using machine learning. The general objetive is design microstructures of hybrids materials using structural optimization.

With advances in the manufacturing technology of microstructures of materials, the interest has increased around material simulation and optimization. One idea that is had with the arrival of new technologies is the design and manufacture of microstructures for desired properties. This is why it seeks to venture into this new field.

During my year of research I will be focusing on the topics of structural optimization and machine learning. In the first instance I will be doing the background check around structural optimization, in addition to reviewing algorithms and testing these. Later I will review the machine learning algorithms for structural optimization. After these months of study that comprise about 4 months I will begin to build structural optimization codes with automatic learning tools, this will be in month 5, After the realization of the codes, proofs of concept and verification of algorithms will be carried out. At the end of this schedule, it is expected to develop a case study to evaluate the proposed methodology, which is accompanied by tests and finally analysis of results and conclusions.

At this moment I am finishing my first month and I feel very good and excited to start this new challenge, I know it will be full of difficult moments, but I hope to overcome them and learn many things that will strengthen my skills as a mechanical engineer.
