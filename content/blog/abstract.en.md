In the field of materials design, there is a current interest in expanding the materials space through the exploration of novel microstructural architectures that leverage the response of independent phases. Additionally, there have been advancements in manufacturing technologies that facilitate the production of materials with specific microstructures. Thus, the focus has shifted from "materials by chance" to "materials by design," where the role of simulation and optimization has gained importance. In an ideal future, we would like to be able to find the microstructure for a given set of desired properties, but currently, this is closer to fiction than reality.

In this project, the goal is to find the microstructure that materials should have for a desired set of properties. To achieve this, traditional structural/topological optimization techniques are combined with machine learning methods.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

- Implement classical and machine learning-based algorithms for structural optimization.
- Develop software with the algorithms described above.

## Methodology

This project spans a one-year period. During this time, topics such as structural optimization and machine learning have been addressed. In the initial stage, a review of background information related to structural optimization was conducted, laying the foundation for further research. Subsequently, the focus shifted to machine learning algorithms applied to structural optimization. In the future, strategies to improve performance and efficiency in structural design decision-making will be explored. Once the code development stage is completed, proof of concept and algorithm verification will be carried out. This will allow the evaluation of the performance and accuracy of the developed models and ensure their effectiveness in applications. At the end of the project, consolidation of all findings through relevant documentation will be pursued.

## Results

Significant progress has been made in several key areas of the project thus far. The review of traditional optimization algorithms has been completed, and several of them have been implemented, with the SIMP method standing out. The SIMP method is being used to generate training data for neural networks. The project is in the final stage of constructing the neural network's proof of concept, which has become a rigorous phase due to the novelty of the topic in the academic field. Initial results from the neural network's proof of concept have yielded some predictions that are not satisfactory when compared to traditional algorithms. Currently, the neural network architecture is being adjusted, and the amount of training samples is being significantly increased.
